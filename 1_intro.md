**Introduction to Python**

## 1. Introduction to Python

Welcome to the **Introduction to Python** tutorial provided by the Full Stack Guild! 

Python is a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. 

It's widely used in web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. 

Here at Vizient, we use Python principally for data analysis and automation.

Let's explore the basic concepts and characteristics of Python programming.

### What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clean and readable syntax. This readability makes Python code easy to understand and maintain. It is widely used for various purposes, from building web applications and scientific computing to creating automation scripts.

### Why Python?

- **Readability:** Python's syntax resembles natural language, making it easy to understand even for beginners.
- **Versatility:** It supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- **Rich Standard Library:** Python comes with a vast collection of built-in modules and libraries that simplify development tasks.
- **Community and Ecosystem:** Python has a large and active community, providing support, documentation, and third-party packages for almost any task.
- **Open Source:** Python is open-source software, allowing developers to use, modify, and distribute it freely.

### Setting the Stage

Before we delve deeper into Python, let's ensure you have the necessary tools to get started.

#### Installing Python

There is a possibility that Python is already installed on your machine. To check, open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS, Linux) and type `python --version`. If you see a version number printed on the screen, you're good to go!

Otherwise, you'll need to install Python on your machine.

At Vizient, installing software on your machine requires admin privileges. If you don't have admin privileges, or do not know how to install things using your elevated (t1) account, then you will need to use an application included on your machine named "Company Portal". This application will allow you to install software on your machine without admin privileges.

Press the Windows key on your keyboard and type `Company Portal`. You should see an application named "Company Portal" appear in the search results. Click on it to open the application.

Once the application is open, click on the `Software` tab on the left side of the window. Search for `Python`, and click on the "Install" button. This will install Python on your machine.

#### Choosing a Code Editor

You'll need a code editor to write and run your Python code. There are several options available, and you can choose based on your preferences:

- **Visual Studio Code:** A popular and powerful code editor with a wide range of extensions for Python development.
- **PyCharm:** A comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) tailored for Python development.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** An interactive environment commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing.

In the next section, we'll set up your development environment and write your first Python program.
